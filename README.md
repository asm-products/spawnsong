## Kickstarter for individual tracks of music.

This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assembly.com/spawnsong](https://assembly.com/spawnsong).

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.

Setting up for development
--------------------------

Follow these instructions to run a local copy of the site or to prepare to deploy a remote server.

 - Install Python 2.7
 - Install `pip` and `virtualenv` python packages (often you can install both with `easy_install virtualenv`)
 - Setup a Virtualenv for the project (this is an isolated copy of Python and the required libraries)
   - Make the vitualenv `virtualenv ~/envs/spawnsong`
   - Activate it `source ~/envs/spawnsong/bin/activate.sh` 
   - Install the needed python libraries (must be run from project root): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Install LESS and Yuglify (for the static file procesing pipeline).
   - Install Node.JS
   - Run `npm install -g less yuglify`

At this point you should have a working Virtualenv, whenever you want to work on the project you must activate it first with `source ~/envs/spawnsong/bin/activate.sh`. You will know this has worked because it will put "(spawnsong)" before your shell prompt.

Setting up local settings
-------------------------

For local configuration you can create a local_settings.py file in the `sites/spawnsongsite` folder. This can be based on local_settings.py.example and should *not* be added to the repository, it allows you to overide some settings just for your local machine. The example version shows settings for using an sqlite database but for a closer match to the production system you may want to use a local copy of PostgreSQL.

Running a local dev server
--------------------------

Once you're swtiched into the Virtualenv and have your `local_settings.py` you can run `honcho -f ProcfileHoncho start` to start the development server. This will also run the Celery server which handles out of process tasks such as transcoding. The web server part will retstart when you make a change but the you will need to manually restart (hit Ctrl-C to shut it down) if you make changes to the Celery tasks.


Thirs Party Components
----------

 - Heroku for hosting
 - Upload storage on Amazon S3
 - File conversion using ffmpeg running on Heroku (use the Linux 64 binary) and run in another process via Celery
   On Ubuntu you'll probably need to install libavcodec-extra-53 which provides libmp3lame audio codec.
 - Echonest for beat locations
 - Mailgun fo rmail delivery
 - Memcachier for caching
 - Stripe for payments
 - Twitter for login
 
Heroku Config
-------------

Uses a special build pack because we need ffmpeg:

    heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/almost/heroku-buildpack-python-ffmpeg.git

Needs memcachier addon for memcached

Need the following additonal Heroku config options:

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    ECHONEST_API_KEY
    MAILGUN_ACCESS_KEY
    MAILGUN_SERVER_NAME
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
    TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
    TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET
